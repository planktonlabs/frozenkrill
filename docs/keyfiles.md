# What are keyfiles?

The keyfile can be __any file__ that you are always able to retrieve on demand. For instance, it can be a publicly available picture, song or book.

It can be your favorite bible verse or your favorite meme. If you are mathematically inclined, it may one or more of your favorite irrational numbers.

It may also be a "personal" file, like your favorite photo of your favorite trip.

You just need enough backups of this file. Public archives like https://archive.org or https://commons.wikimedia.org/ may be useful on this context.

It may also be something very different from the examples above. Creativity is important here.

But no matter what you pick, pick something.

## Even a simple keyfile is better than no keyfile

It's **highly recommended** to use at least one keyfile when creating a wallet.

If the password is really strong, it's easy to be forgotten. If it's weak, it can be brute forced (even with the builtin brute force protections)

A keyfile provides a __complementary strong password__ (entropy) that is __easy to remember__.
